## Introduction

### What?

Droidrunco is a cross-platform web UI based application which utilizes `adb` to help
remove unwanted system apps ([bloatware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat)) from
on all versions of Android with x86 or ARM processors without root access. This subsequently
increases storage space, reduces power consumption and hardens the user's privacy against
vendor distributed spyware.

### Why?

Despite the existence of projects like [the UAD project](https://github.com/0x192/Universal-Android-Debloater),
there has recently been a lot of trouble correlating package names with an app's label.
Manufacturers including Oppo, Xiaomi and the like use obscure package names for their spyware
apps which make it difficult if not impossible to remove them without playing Russian roulette
and risking a [bootloop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootloop).

### How?

Droidrunco solves the aforementioned issue by fetching the package names as well as app labels
using its extractor binaries. This can help the user get better insights on whether an app is
safe to get rid of.

With that said, a user still risks hitting a bootloop if they have absolutely
no idea of what they're doing.

## Installation

### Install ADB

#### Linux
- Debian: `sudo apt install android-sdk-platform-tools`
- Arch: `sudo pacman -S android-tools`
- Red Hat: `sudo yum install android-tools`
- OpenSUSE: `sudo zypper install android-tools`
- Termux: `pkg in android-tools`

#### macOS
Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/#install) and run the following in the terminal:    
```bash
brew install android-platform-tools
```

#### Windows
Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install#install-step2) and run the following in a PowerShell window with administrator privileges:
```powershell
choco install adb
```

### Install Droidrunco

Droidrunco can be installed in either of the following ways:

#### Using precompiled binaries
This is what most users will use since it does not involve setting up a development environment. Download the binary for your operating system from the [releases](https://github.com/lavafroth/droidrunco/releases).

#### From source

To build from source, please install [`just`](https://just.systems). It's being used as a replacement for the much complicated GNU `make` and `Makefile`s.

Clone the repository and create a clean build.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lavafroth/droidrunco.git
cd droidrunco
just build-all
```

#### From the AUR

Archlinux users can install droidrunco from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/droidrunco). Thank you robertfoster for packaging the app.

## Usage
- Backup the data on your device before you accidentally screw up
- [Enable Developer Options and USB debugging on your device](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable)
- From the settings, disconnect from any OEM / vendor accounts (deleting an OEM account package could lock you on the lockscreen because the device can no longer associate your identity)
- Kill any previously running adb servers on the host
```
adb kill-server
```
- Run Droidrunco (this might need administrative rights depending on the operation system in use)
- Visit http://localhost:8080
- Start typing to search for an app
- Click the trash icon next to the app's entry to wipe it. The icon color indicated the severity of uninstalling the app.
  - Green: Recommended
  - Lime: Advanced
  - Yellow: Expert
  - Red: Unsafe
  - Gray: Untested
- If an essential system app gets accidentally removed and Droidrunco is still running, click the recycle icon next to the entry to restore it

## Debloating without a PC

The best part about Droidrunco is that you can run the [ARM version](https://github.com/lavafroth/droidrunco/releases/latest) in [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/) and debloat Android 11+ devices.

- In the Android Developer Options, enable wireless debugging
- Under wireless debugging, click on pair a device, note the IP:PORT pair and the KEY.

- Open termux and run the following:

```sh
pkg in wget adb
adb pair IP:PORT KEY
```

Where IP, PORT and KEY are the identifiers noted from the wireless debugging menu.

- Back in the wireless debugging settings page, note the IP and PORT for _connecting_ to the device.
Note that the PORT is usually different in this case.

- Run the following in Termux:

```sh
adb connect IP:PORT
```

- The target device should get a notification stating that a debugger has been connected.

- Finally run the following in Termux:

```sh
wget https://github.com/lavafroth/droidrunco/releases/download/v2.3.2/droidrunco-arm-linux
chmod +x droidrunco-arm-linux
./droidrunco-arm-linux
```

> Note: The version used here is 2.3.2 but you may use a higher version if available.

- Go [here](http://localhost:8080).
